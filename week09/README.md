## Goals 

The goal of this weekly assignment was to create a new table for my sensor data and begin writing values to it at a frequency of every five minutes.

## Solution 
To complete this assignment I modified the starter code to store my data in a SQL database. Below are images of the API status and the first temperature it collected.
