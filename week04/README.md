## Goal 
Taking the data that I have parsed from the AA zone, the goal of this weeks assignment is to create a relational database. There are four steps to achieving this goal; planning, creating a table, populating the table and checking the result. Each of these steps are defined in my through files uploaded and individual JS files. 

## Solution in Steps

### 1. Planning the database. 
When initally planning my database, I thought of the heirachy of the data itself (photo below). While this is beneifical to understanding the structure of content, the structure for a relational database is better suited in multiple tables. Using illustrator I mapped out the three tables I will need for the AA data structure; locationGeo, schedule and meetings. Using IDs for the location and meetings feeds into the schedule table without having duplicate information.
