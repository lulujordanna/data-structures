#  Goals 

The goal of this final weekly assignment is to create interface designs for the three data sources we have been working with this semester. In doing so we must address 

* What will the visualization look like? Will it be interactive? If so, how?
* How will the data need to be mapped to the visual elements?
* For that mapping, what needs to be done to the data? Be specific and clear. Will it require filtering, aggregation, restructuring, and/or something else? How will this be done?
* What is the default view (if any)?
* What assumptions are you making about the user?

## Assignment 1: AA Meetings 

For Assignment 1, I want to create a clean, user friendly visualization to make the information highly accessible. My goal of this project is to create a long term planning tool which users can use to find the right AA Meeting for them, based on defined geographic neighborhoods. As I am building this project,  I am assuming that future users live in Manhattan and are comfortable with defining their geographic location in proximity to an AA Meeting. The following images highlight the visual design of the  interactive map. Users will land on the default view (Image 1) and have to choose their neighbourhood to recieve information. Once the neighborhood is chosen, the map will reposition and meetings will appear (Image 2). When the user clicks on the map pointers, details about the meetings at that location will appear (Image 3).

## Assignment 2: Process Blog 
For Assignment 2, I want to create a simplistic blog which is driven by the content of each post. It will track my progression in learning javascript and enhancing my Data Visualization knowledge through the reflections in Data Structures, Major Studio and Data Visualization and Information Aesthetics. Each reflection has a category (a project) which is the primary key for the structure of the blog and a sort key; the date. The default view will be in order of posts based on the category but users will be able to filter based on the date and/or category. The following image is a sketch of the design with two different types of posts (one with an image and one without). Based on my design I am making the assumptions that users will scroll through the page to navigate, click on the button's to learn more via my github page and understand that the top menu is a source of filtering.

## Assignment 3: Temperature Sensor  
For the final assignment, I want to create a interactive visualization that records the temperature of my bedroom, accounting for the times when I have my Air Conditioner on. The following images highlight the visual design for the project. The first image is the default view, while the second image is what occurs when you hover over a selected period. If the Air Conditioner was on during that time, a highlight and toolip would appear. Ultimately, if time permits, I would like to have a feature where you could click to see all the times the Air Conditioner was on (image 3). For this project, I am making the assumption that users will hover over my graph in order to gain further knowlege about my AC behaviours.
