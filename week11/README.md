#  Goals 

The goal of this final weekly assignment is to create interface designs for the three data sources we have been working with this semester. In doing so we must address 

* What will the visualization look like? Will it be interactive? If so, how?
* How will the data need to be mapped to the visual elements?
* For that mapping, what needs to be done to the data? Be specific and clear. Will it require filtering, aggregation, restructuring, and/or something else? How will this be done?
* What is the default view (if any)?
* What assumptions are you making about the user?

## Assignment 1: AA Meetings 

For Assignment 1, I want to create a clean, user friendly visualization to make the information highly accessible. My goal of this project is to create a long term planning tool which users can use to find the right AA Meeting for them, based on defined geographic neighborhoods. As I am building this project,  I am assuming that future users live in Manhattan and are comfortable with defining their geographic location in proximity to an AA Meeting. The following images highlight the visual design of the  interactive map. Users will land on the default view (Image 1) and have to choose their neighbourhood to recieve information. Once the neighborhood is chosen, the map will reposition and meetings will appear (Image 2). When the user clicks on the map pointers, details about the meetings at that location will appear (Image 3).
